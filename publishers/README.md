These contain publisher images where Kavita can't pull an icon from naturally. Kavita will fallback to this location.

The format is "Publisher Name"|relative location to file

If there are multiple names for a publisher, like Black Mask, which may be "Black Mask Studio" or "Black Mask", use both and put a # between. 
You may use anything for the filename, ideally the first name of the publisher line.

The file size of an image should not exceed 5KB.
